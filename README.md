# FindingNankai

  <em><b>Finding Nankai</b></em> is an Android App, available at Google Play Store and targeted at giving a brief but enjoyable introduction of <a href="http://www.nankai.edu.cn">Nankai University</a> to users. 
  Plus, this is my individual project at <a href="https://www.studyjamscn.com/thread-21946-1-1.html">Google StudyJams China 2017</a>.
  Any participant of Google StudyJams China who wishes to be awarded a certificate upon completion of StudyJams’ teaching courses, must share enough notes on Android courses, and finish an individual project(individually and no plagiarism of course) to apply for the certificate.
